	<title>Known Issues and Caveats</title>

	<para>Here is the list of known issues in this release of OpenNMS.</para>

	<!--
	<section id="issues-current-release">
		<title>Current Release</title>
		<para>
			The simple topology provider (and by extension, the VMware provider) for the topology
			UI currently do not work.  They will return in a future 1.13 release.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="issues-1.12.7">
		<title>OpenNMS 1.12.7/1.13.2</title>
		<para>
			As of OpenNMS 1.12.7, we have replaced the code that creates the OpenNMS web UI
			with the standard jetty.xml instead.
		</para>
		<para>
			This means that if you need to do any customization (adding AJP support, changing
			limits on threads or post sizes, etc.) you can now do so by editing a standard
			jetty.xml file instead. While most of the simple Jetty configuration properties
			from $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties are still supported, it is strongly
			recommended that you instead copy $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/examples/jetty.xml to
			$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/jetty.xml and edit that, rather than relying on properties from
			the config file(s).
		</para>
		<para>
			The majority of users will have to change nothing, but if you have done any
			configuration changes relating to Jetty, you may need to review them.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="issues-1.8.5">
		<title>OpenNMS 1.8.5/1.9.2</title>
		<para>
			When upgrading OpenNMS to version 1.8.5 or later, it is important to upgrade your
			remote pollers to 1.8.5 as well.  The remote poller wire protocol has changed
			since 1.8.4.
